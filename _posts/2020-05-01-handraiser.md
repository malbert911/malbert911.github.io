While our classes were temporarily suspended due to COVID-19, a classmate and me started this project. The objective is to provide an easy way for teachers to get feedback from students in an online class. Hand Raiser allows individuals to create rooms, have other join it, create quick polls and track whose hand is raised! 

[The code is open source and can be found on Github](https://github.com/malbert911/HandRaiser)

This project was also submitted to the COVID-19 Global Hackathon on Devpost. [More technical details are listed there.](https://devpost.com/software/hand-raiser)

The college recognized our work and awarded us the John Abbott College - Service & Leadership Award (2019-2020)
